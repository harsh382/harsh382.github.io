Our project is a prototype of an automated plant disease detection bot. 
As we know, the existing method for plant disease detection is simply naked eye observation by the concerned practitioner, which is a very laborious and time-consuming task. Automatic detection will take fewer efforts and save time, which is what we aim for.
The project consists of a robotic arm with the base of a simple xlr8 bot. The robotic arm scans the plants’ leaves and detects yellow spots on them, which it considers as a ‘disease’. We are using Haar Cascade to detect yellow spots on the leaves. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a big number of positive(containing spots) and negative(anything which is not a disease) images.
