Texture classification is an important area of research in computer vision and pattern recognition. The texture based descriptors have been used for object, scene and face classification. Among a number of approaches, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) (Ojala et al., 2002) has gained a popularity due to computational simplicity and good performance

Local Binary Patterns, or LBPs for short, are a texture descriptor made popular by the work of Ojala et al. in their 2002 paper, [Multiresolution Grayscale and Rotation Invariant Texture Classification with Local Binary Patterns](http://www.outex.oulu.fi/publications/pami_02_opm.pdf).

In recent years, it has aroused increasing interest in many areas of image processing and computer vision and has shown its effectiveness in a number of applications, in particular for facial image analysis, including tasks as diverse as face detection, face recognition, facial expression analysis, and demographic classification..

I used it for Liveness Detection (Anti-spoofing) during my internship at [Augle AI](www.augle.ai).
